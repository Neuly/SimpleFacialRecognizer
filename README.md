# SimpleFacialRecognizer

I am currently building a mancave with my father in law (he mainly builds it). However, due to another project I had got some webcams left, and when I was tyding out, I decided to put some of these webcams to a greather good. 

However, I thought about useful projects. I had ideas like starting the screen automatically when I am doing some gesture or when I am sitting in front of it. So this is how I ended up typing these lines. My idea ist simple: When I am sitting in front of the televesion for more than three seconds, I want the television to wake up and to switch the channel to a given one. It should also tell me the current time via my speakers and play my favorite chill out song.

# Set Up

This will follow as soon, as I made some progress in my project. Please visit my project page for details.

# Minimum Goals

The minimum goal is a positive facial detection of myself and of other persons who are sitting in front of it. It should track them and save their face information for later. 

# Software Design

One of my working colleagues [Grasi](https://github.com/StefanGrasmann)
, who is always challenging me in programming stuff, once taught me, to make my project as flexible as possible and to make it reusable. So I am doing so: The webcam capturing and the facial detection will be completly seperated from each other. The actions, which should be done when specified persons enther the rooms, are in another module project.
